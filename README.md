**HALXP-Comfy** (High Availability & Layout eXtension Pack) is a professional UI suite for ComfyUI designed to enhance workflow management.

This extension is the starting point for a growing collection of UI tools. Currently, it features **HALXP Focus**, a smart navigation utility, with more enhancements currently in development.

**Verified working on:** Legacy UI, ComfyUI V1 (Nodes 2.0), and Portable Distributions.

## ⚠️ Prerequisite
**This extension requires [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to be installed.**
The HALXP UI elements are designed to dock seamlessly alongside the ComfyUI Manager button in the main menu.

## 🌟 Features

### 1. HALXP Focus
A smart "Focus" button injected into your main menu bar.
* **Auto-Follow:** Smoothly pans the camera to the currently executing node, allowing you to watch your workflow progress hands-free.
* **Smart Docking:** Automatically detects the ComfyUI Manager button and injects itself seamlessly beside it.
* **Visual Feedback:** Features a status indicator (Green dot = Active) so you always know when auto-follow is engaged.
* **V1 Compatible:** Works natively with the new Vue.js frontend and PrimeVue menus.

### 2. More Coming Soon
HALXP is built as a modular suite. Expect future updates to include additional layout and debugging tools to further improve your ComfyUI experience.
